<h1> Crypto Tracker </h1>

Crypto Tracker is a demo portfolio and crypto currency information tracking app. The app does function however information may not be upto date and will have to manually be updated. With Crypto Tracker you can manage your portfolio and include both currencies listed within the app or your personal input (with limited functionality).

<h2> Installation </h2>
To download this app, fork and clone both the frontend and backend repo (seperate).
<br>
Before setting up the frontend, please set up the backend.
<br>
Within the frontend repo terminal, type:
<br>

```
npm install
```
<br>
Next run the server using:
<br>

```
npm start
```
<br>
If errors occur upon app start up, open the chrome developer console (generally f12 on your keyboard) and type:
<br>

```
localStorage.user = 0
```
<br>

<h2> Usage </h2>
From here, you can select a currency, view its information such as the highs and lows for the day, current value, marketcap, and supply. After signing up, you will gain access to using the portfolio tracker where you can monitor the amount of each currency as well as the total value of each investment (if the coin is supported).
